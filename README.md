# Realistic Vehicle System

This repository showcases my work using a vehicle system designed to simulate realistic car behavior. While I didn’t create this system myself, I spent over a month learning how to use and adapt it effectively. Through trial and error and an in-depth study of its blueprints, I developed a workflow to make it fully functional and usable with a player character.

## Features
- **Realistic Car Physics:** The system provides a detailed simulation of car behavior, creating an immersive driving experience.
- **Custom Player Integration:** Modified the system to work seamlessly with player-controlled characters.
- **Blueprint-Based Learning:** Thoroughly explored and understood the system’s blueprints to adapt it for different use cases.

## Setup Guide
Follow these steps to set up your own car model using this vehicle system:

1. **Import Your Car Model**
   - Ensure your car model is properly rigged and set up for use in the system.
   - Import it into your project and check for compatibility.

2. **Configure the Vehicle System**
   - Attach your car model to the vehicle blueprint.
   - Map the necessary inputs for steering, acceleration, and braking.

3. **Integrate with Player Character**
   - Modify the system to allow player control.
   - Test transitions between the player character and vehicle to ensure smooth interaction.

4. **Test and Optimize**
   - Test the vehicle’s handling, physics, and overall functionality.
   - Make adjustments to improve performance and realism.

## Challenges and Learnings
Understanding and adapting this vehicle system was not an easy task. It took me over a month of studying blueprints, troubleshooting, and experimenting to create a functional setup. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into blueprint-based systems and learned how to overcome obstacles to achieve the desired outcome.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository.
- Import the vehicle system and car model into your Unreal Engine project.
- Follow the setup guide to integrate the system with your own models and characters.

## Future Improvements
- Adding advanced features such as damage simulation and customizable vehicle settings.
- Enhancing player interaction mechanics for more intuitive controls.
- Creating a video tutorial to complement the written setup guide.

Feel free to explore this repository and adapt the system for your own projects. If you have any questions or feedback, don’t hesitate to reach out!
